I created this program based on the prevous week 1 question on entering the age but this time ive added a if statement to output a response if the user if above or below the age of 18. If they are below it will output that they are below the age of 18 and if they are above it will save they are above 18. I also encoutered a syntax error where i forgot to add a semicolon at the end of the code line so i fixed that and the code started working correctly.

I have created this program to allow a user to input their grade from A to F and depending on what they get the will receive a message from first class to you have failed. I used an if statement to perform this as well as else if statements for multiple and used the scanner class to allow for user input. I encountered some syntax errors just incorrectly formatting the curly braces for each else if statement but once that was fixed the code worked.

I created a program where the code outputs the numbers from 0 to 9 and ive done this by making a for loop which inlcudes i=0 where starts counting from 0; then making i<=9 so that it outputs the numbers from 0 to 9 and i++ where it adds 1 each time.

I created a program in which it printed out the 7 times tables and i did this by making a for loop with the parameters i=1 which starts at 1 and then i<=12 which goes up to 12 and i++ which increments by 1 each time. I then wrote (i*7) which makes the current value times by 7 and the calucaltion is displayed in a formatted output. I tested the program and it correctly formed the 7 times table from 1 to 12.

I created this program basically identical to the previous one but added the scanner class so that the user can input a number they want and then it will give them times table for that number until 12. I kept the for loop the same but added the number variable which is from the users input and then i ran the program and it worked correctly.

I created this program to allow for a user to input a number for the times table they want to see and i made it a do while loop so that the program runs first and then asks if they want to continue. The user enters a number and the for loop displays it from 1 to 12. If the users wants to continue they press Y so it restarts and if they type N then the program will end and it will display a goodbye message. I encountered errors such as forgetting semi colons at end of code lines and typing i = 1 instead of adding the int part before it. Once i fixed these issues the code worked as intended and i inputted different results to show that it worked.

I have created this program to allow a user to enter a mark between 0 and 100 and i use if statements to give a grade based on the amount of marks they got. I used to scanner library to allow for user input and this time when i created the program i only missed a semi colon at the end of the code which was quickly fixed and thus resulted in the program working correctly.

I created this program to output only even numbers and i did this by making a for loop which starts at 1, is less or equal to 10 and goes up in 1.Then i created a if statement where if i divided by 2 is 0 then it means its even so it will print it.

I created this program to convert both feet to miles and miles to feet and i did this by creating an if statement based on if the user presses m or f. If he presses f it will tell him to input number of feet and it will give the miles and vice versa if the user presses m. I also did a else statement to make sure if they dont press either then it will output with invalid input. I encountered some syntax issues such as missing semi colons at the end of the code line and some spelling mistakes but once those were fixed it worked perfectly.
