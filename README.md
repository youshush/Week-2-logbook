I created this program based on the prevous week 1 question on entering the age but this time ive added a if statement to output a response if the user if above or below the age of 18. If they are below it will output that they are below the age of 18 and if they are above it will save they are above 18. I also encoutered a syntax error where i forgot to add a semicolon at the end of the code line so i fixed that and the code started working correctly.
