I created this program based on the prevous week 1 question on entering the age but this time ive added a if statement to output a response if the user if above or below the age of 18. If they are below it will output that they are below the age of 18 and if they are above it will save they are above 18. I also encoutered a syntax error where i forgot to add a semicolon at the end of the code line so i fixed that and the code started working correctly.

I have created this program to allow a user to input their grade from A to F and depending on what they get the will receive a message from first class to you have failed. I used an if statement to perform this as well as else if statements for multiple and used the scanner class to allow for user input. I encountered some syntax errors just incorrectly formatting the curly braces for each else if statement but once that was fixed the code worked.

I created a program where the code outputs the numbers from 0 to 9 and ive done this by making a for loop which inlcudes i=0 where starts counting from 0; then making i<=9 so that it outputs the numbers from 0 to 9 and i++ where it adds 1 each time.

I created a program in which it printed out the 7 times tables and i did this by making a for loop with the parameters i=1 which starts at 1 and then i<=12 which goes up to 12 and i++ which increments by 1 each time. I then wrote (i*7) which makes the current value times by 7 and the calucaltion is displayed in a formatted output. I tested the program and it correctly formed the 7 times table from 1 to 12.
